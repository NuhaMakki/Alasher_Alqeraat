## 📌 Project Description

**QURANIC Web Development** is a web application designed to assist **Quran and Qira’at students and teachers** in navigating complex data related to variations and rules in Quranic recitations (**حريرات القراءات**).

This project integrates a MySQL database built from the *[al-nashr fه al-qirā'āt al-'ashr Book](https://shamela.ws/book/22642)* by **Ibn Al-Jazari**, organizing a vast amount of detailed Qira’at data into a user-friendly interface.

Users can search and explore:
- How each **Qāri’**, **Rāwī**, or **Ṭarīq** reads specific elements (e.g., **Madd Munfaṣil**, **Hamz Sākin**)
- What rules are applied, such as replacing or pronouncing **Hamzah**, with visual and tabular representations.
